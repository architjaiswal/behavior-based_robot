# behavior-based_robot

https://youtu.be/_2Z5Oa3pxvA 

A behavior-based object finding and removal robot that is able to move from an unknown position in an in-door environment to look for an object, raise an alarm, and push the object off its location on the floor.

The robot should use a set of behaviors, including “wander” (search) and “wall following”.

The walls of the rooms will be marked with 2” wide (1.88”) blue painters tape and the object will be an empty soda can sitting on top of a red square made with red painters tape. 

There will be no ”door” openings to the outside of the house and the robot is to find the object, move towards it, indicate when it is within 1 foot of the object (using either a tone or a light), and then push it off the marking it is sitting on.
